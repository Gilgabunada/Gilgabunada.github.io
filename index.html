            <h3> Computer Engineering Student</h3>
            <p>Hi! I'm Gil Gabunada, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Cebu Main Campus. Living in the vibrant city of Cebu, 
                I’m passionate about developing tech solutions that can positively impact people's lives. My journey in engineering combines 
                both hardware and software, and I love working on projects that challenge me to innovate—from robotics to automation systems.

                For me, engineering goes beyond creating technology; it’s about driving meaningful change. Through my work and experiences, 
                I aim to inspire others to explore the field of engineering and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
                
                Feel free to explore my portfolio, where you’ll find a collection of my projects, achievements, and aspirations. 
                I hope that my journey can inspire someone to follow their passion in tech, just as I’m pursuing mine.</p>
